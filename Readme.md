# How to use the Workflow Module with the Entity Framework data model


<p>This example uses the EF-based version of the XPO-based Workflow Demo application that is shipped with XAF. It demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#eXpressAppFramework/CustomDocument113343">Workflow Module</a>  in XAF applications where <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/data/ef.aspx">Microsoft ADO.NET Entity Framework</a> is used for data access. The Workflow Module integrates <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/jj684582.aspx">Windows Workflow Foundation(WF) 4.0/4.5</a> support into XAF. WF is a workflow management framework designed to assist you in creating more manageable, workflow-enabled applications. Leveraging the WF functionality, the Workflow module is designed specifically for applications that need to handle automatic long-running business processes with intermediate steps, for example, hours, days or weeks apart, allowing users to modify automated business processes without writing any code and visualizing complex business processes. <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong><em>You need to run Visual Studio as an administrator to try this example. Otherwise, the "This task requires the application to have elevated permissions" error will occur. The reason is that this example starts the service that listens to the 46232 port.</em></p>
